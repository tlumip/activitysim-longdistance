    The new index values are stable based on the person_id, tour_type, and tour_num.
    The existing index is ignored and replaced.

    This gives us a stable (predictable) tour_id with tours in canonical order
    (when tours are sorted by tour_id, tours for each person
    of the same type will be adjacent and in increasing tour_type_num order)

    It also simplifies attaching random number streams to tours that are stable
